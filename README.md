💫 I work with my hands to make magic happen using software. 

- ✨ I’m currently working on a small test project with Godot and Windows automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about .NET and how to integrate it with WebView.
- ⚡ My ultimate goal is to create a Windows experience as close to Linux as possible.
